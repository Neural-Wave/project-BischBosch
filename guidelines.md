# Guidelines for Project Submission: Neural Wave

To ensure a correct validation for your hackathon project, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Code Submission
1. **Organize Your Code**:  
   - Create a well-structured repository with clear folder naming (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`).  
   - Include a `README.md` with an overview, instructions for running the code, and dependencies.  
2. **Upload to Lightning AI**:  
   - List dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yaml`.  
   - Ensure Lightning components and workflows are documented and configured in `main.py` or the respective script.

## Step 2: Report Creation
1. **Report Content**:  
   - Write a report max 3 pages using the editor provided by Lightning AI detailing:  
     - **Project Title**: Brief and descriptive.  
     - **Objective**: The problem being addressed and its significance.  
     - **Approach**: Methodology, algorithms, and frameworks used.  
     - **Results**: Key findings, metrics, or visualizations.  
     - **Challenges**: Difficulties encountered and solutions.  
2. **Format and Publishing**:  
   - Keep the report concise and well-formatted.  
   - Include images, tables, or links as necessary.  

## Step 3: Video Explanation
1. **Record a Video**:  
   - Create a short video max 2 minutes that explains:  
     - Your project goal and relevance.  
     - Key results and their interpretation.  
   - Use visuals like charts, diagrams, or code snippets for better understanding.  
2. **Upload the Video**:  
   - Include the video file in the project directory.

## Step 4: Final Submission and Publishing
1. **Check All Files**:  
   - Ensure your code, report, and video are properly formatted and included.  
   - Review for completeness and accuracy. 
   - Ensure to give credit to any external sources used in your project. No plagiarism is allowed, make sure to cite any references included ChatGPT. 
2. **Proper studio publishing and configuration**:
   - Only one submission per team, and decide as a group what is the best settings for the studio given the requirements of your solution.
   - Make sure when publishing the studio that the studio visibility is only limited to the organization Neuralwave Hackathon, and also if the project you are doing is under some NDA contract, we suggest you to remove any sensitive data before publishing.
   - While publishing the studio, you'll be given the option to choose a title and summary for your publication, the title must follow the next format `Company Name | Team Name`, and in the summary you must write all the member's full name, and possibly their role.

For any issues during submission, please contact the hackathon organizers or refer to the Lightning AI documentation. Good luck!
